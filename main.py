# another important thing is how git works
# you turn on pc, download the changes, you make a change to the code
# so you change the code and approve it
# you would have to return to the last version of the fucking G
#
# if you would make 10000000 changes, then the programe would have to make 1 000 000 ways back
#
# git copys the files and causes data redundance. Here you can see the process of workflow,
# there are 3 areaas you store your files: working directory, staging area, git directory (repository)
#
# you in your working directory make a change and the chagnge will stage ( for example I change file A and then file ABCDEF)
# you approove the changes by "COMMITING"
#
# Modify, Stage, Commit
# untucked file, you have to add, remove, or ignore new files (let's say db.php, login credentials etc.')

# You would leak your password, that's why you add it to git ignore, otherwise your passwords will be leaked.
# Every file has it's unicate commit. check sum - it's for keeping the same versions, so people know that it's the same

# you basically make a hash of your version and then people compare the hash of the received file with your hash, so they
# can check if it's legitimate
